<!-- 3. IDENTIFYING VOLCANO HAZARDS -->
<!-- ================================= -->
<section id="hazards">
    <h2>3. Identifying Volcano Hazards</h2>

    <article>
        <h3>Lava Flows</h3>
        <p>
        Lava flows occur when magma from below earths crust escapes to the surface and runs down slopes.
        Most lava flows move slowly and are a result of volcanic activity.
        The speed and distance of a lava flow depend on how thick or runny the lava is.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Pyroclastic Flows</h3>
        <p>
        Pyroclastic flows are fast-moving clouds of extremely hot gas, ash, and volcanic rock that
        rush down the sides of a volcano during explosive eruptions. These flows can travel very fast and dont offer much evacuation time.
        Thankfully they usualy dont get very far from the volcano.
        Because of their speed and heat, pyroclastic flows are one of the most dangerous volcanic hazards.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Lahars</h3>
        <p>
        Lahars are volcanic mudflows made of water, ash, rock, and debris that flow down river valleys
        and slopes near a volcano. They can be triggered by heavy rain, melting snow, or volcanic eruptions.
        Lahars behave like flowing concrete and can travel long distances, burying towns and damaging
        structures far from the volcano.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Ash Clouds</h3>
        <p>
        Volcanic ash clouds form when explosive eruptions send tiny fragments of rock and glass high
        into the atmosphere. Falling ash can damage buildings, contaminate water supplies, harm lungs,
        and disrupt transportation. Ash clouds are especially dangerous to aircraft because ash particles
        can damage jet engines.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Volcanic Gasses</h3>
        <p>
        Volcanoes release gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide during eruptions.
        Some volcanic gases can be harmful or deadly when concentrated, especially in low-lying areas.
        These gases can also cause acid rain and contribute to air pollution that affects people,
        animals, and plants.
        </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h3>Climate Effects</h3>
        <p>
        Large volcanic eruptions can affect Earth's climate by releasing ash and sulfur-rich gases
        into the upper atmosphere. These particles reflect sunlight back into space, which can lower
        global temperatures for months or even years. Historic eruptions have caused temporary cooling
        and changes in weather patterns around the world.

    <h2>4. What to Do When Visiting a Volcano</h2>

    <section>
        <h3>Before Visiting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the volcano’s current activity and alert level with local authorities.</li>
            <li>Wear sturdy shoes, long pants, and weather-appropriate clothing for rugged terrain.</li>
            <li>Bring essential supplies such as water, snacks, sunscreen, a hat, and a map of the area.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>While Visiting</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Stay on marked trails and follow all safety signs and instructions from guides.</li>
            <li>Keep a safe distance from lava flows, fumaroles, and unstable slopes.</li>
            <li>Wear a mask or cover your nose and mouth if ash or volcanic dust is present.</li>
